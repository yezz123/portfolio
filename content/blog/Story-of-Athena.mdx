AthenaÂ : is a web application developed in Python-Flask-SQLite for testing your skills as a HackerÂ , Coder and Warrior.

Behind linesÂ , Why I choose this name cause it look more dramatic for the project.I am inspired a lot from Athena for example, how she was a great woman with a great power & how she inspire from life and acting for civilization.

That is for you, cause when you try to escape and use Athena, you break into a world of 0's & 1's for testing your power of coding and breaking into the hidden part.

The good side or the side where I respect all OWASP ASVS that show also the good side of thinking that Athena has.

The bad side is where you can test your hidden skills and see if you can break the rules to making it a safe one like Athena did when she fight for civilization.

But this is not a civilization war is a war again vulnerability, develop your skills of coding & problem solving with it.

![Athena Parthenos](/images/blog/06/02.png)

She was the daughter of Zeus, produced without a mother, so that she emerged full-grown from his forehead. There was an alternative story that Zeus swallowed Metis, the goddess of counsel, while she was pregnant with Athena, so that Athena finally emerged from Zeus. Being the favorite child of Zeus, she had great power.

Athena's association with the acropolises of various Greek cities probably stemmed from the location of the kings' palaces there. She was thought to have had neither consort nor offspring. She may not have been described as a virgin originally, but virginity was attributed to her very early and was the basis for the interpretation of her epithets Pallas and Parthenos. As a war goddess Athena could not be dominated by other goddesses, such as Aphrodite, and as a palace goddess she could not be violated.

In Homer's Iliad, Athena, as a war goddess, inspires and fights alongside the Greek heroes; her aid is synonymous with military prowess. Also in the Iliad, Zeus, the chief god, specifically assigns the sphere of war to Ares, the god of war, and Athena. Athena's moral and military superiority to Ares derives in part from the fact that she represents the intellectual and civilized side of war and the virtues of justice and skill, whereas Ares represents mere blood lust. Her superiority also derives in part from the vastly greater variety and importance of her functions and from the patriotism of Homer's predecessors, Ares being of foreign origin. In the Iliad, Athena is the divine form of the heroic, martial ideal: she personifies excellence in close combat, victory, and glory. The qualities that lead to victory are found on the aegis, or breastplate, that Athena wears when she goes to war: fear, strife, defense, and assault. Athena appears in Homer's Odyssey as the tutelary deity of Odysseus, and myths from later sources portray her similarly as helper of Perseus and Heracles (Hercules). As the guardian of the welfare of kings, Athena became the goddess of good counsel, of prudent restraint and practical insight, as well as of war.

If you find this a great project drop a Star & reccommand it to your warrior friend ðŸ‘‹.
